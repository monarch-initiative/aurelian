description: "A small classic dataset from Fisher, 1936. One of the earliest known datasets used for evaluating classification methods. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other."
